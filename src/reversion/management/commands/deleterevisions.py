If an app or a model is specified, revisions that have an other app/model involved will not be deleted. Use --force to avoid that.

You can specify only apps/models or only delay or date or use a combination of both.

Examples:

        deleterevisons myapp
    
    That will delete every revisions of myapp (except if there's an other app involved in the revision)
    
        deleterevisons --date=2010-11-01
    
    That will delete every revisions created before November 1, 2010 for all apps.
    
        deleterevisons myapp.mymodel --year=1 --month=2 --force
        
    That will delete every revisions of myapp.model that are older then 1 year and 2 months (14 months) even if there's revisions involving other apps and/or models.
